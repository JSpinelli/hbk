    content: I never thought I would witness the end. I don't care what some are
      saying, this is the end. Our god fell, we are doomed.
  - type: 5
    number: 2
    date: 3562
    content: What to do when god dies? Should we re-evaluate our beliefs? Maybe it
      was never a god, gods can't die. The Giver must have been something else, maybe
      an avatar for our true god?
  - type: 5
    number: 3
    date: 3562
    content: Who will give us a food now? We are powerless without the Giver! How
      are we to obtain the energy to keep living?
  - type: 5
    number: 4
    date: 3562
    content: This is the fault of the non believers. If it wasn't for their heresy
      the Giver would have had the strength to combat the black sun. We should punish
      them!
  - type: 5
    number: 5
    date: 3562
    content: I think we should worship the black sun, it clearly is the stronger
      entity in all the land. If we pray to it, we will get the food we need.
  - type: 5
    number: 6
    date: 3562
    content: They are gone, the body fell, crushed thousands in the process. Funny
      to think those were the lucky ones. Now we are fighting for the last scraps
      of energy.

    number: 7
    date: 3562
    content: 'I would have liked for our god to had died a different day, maybe a
      week later. At least I would have had my date by then, now it is just chaos.
      And nobody wants to date in the middle of chaos. '
  - type: 5
    number: 8
    date: 3562
    content: The black sun cult has gained a lot of followers lately. And it seems
      to be working, the ground has started to shake. I hope we get food next.
  - type: 5
    number: 9
    date: 3562
    content: I'm gone into hiding for my last days. The crazy cultists have decided
      to start sacrificing the ones that don't belive in the black sun. I would like
      to at least have the decency to die fro starvation.
  - type: 5
    number: 10
    date: 3562
    content: I'm sure that at some point we crossed a line we shouldn't have. Somewhere
      between exiling non believers and sacrificing them to the black sun. I also
      don't think any of this is working, no food has rained since the Giver died.
  - type: 5
    number: 11
    date: 3562
    content: It will never not be funny when I scrap some of the metal and the little
      crystal things go crazy. They look pretty dumb when they eat, I don't know
      why someone would want to research them. Nobody is here aside from me so I
      won't do it.
  - type: 5
    number: 12
    date: 3562
    content: Fuck, the sun collapsed into a black hole. I'm sooo fucked. Welp, I
      had a good run.
  - type: 5
    number: 13
    date: 3562
    content: Based on my power consumption I will probably be dead in a few days.
      I don't really have any regrets. Had a nice life in this planet. Though I never
      really did any of the research I should have.

      TX345. Mission: Crystal based life identification. Progress: None, I didn''t
      really like them so I just walked around for a few years. '

      first Arloran to venture inside. I'll be a legend.

      nothing, my eyes see nothing. I can only assume there is nothing here.

    date: 123355345999650
    content: It's been a year since my last entry, nothing happened since. Just me,
      my ship, my mind and my void. Today I felt like I should write this down for
      some reason.
  - type: 1
    number: 5
    date: 123355345999650
    content: My instruments have detected something, a blip in the computer, a sound
      I had forgotten. Finally I have something to explore.

    date: 123355345999650
    content: I hit it! I'm stuck. I lost. I fear this is my end. I realeased my logs
      to the void. To whoever finds them. What the fuck where you thinking? Get out
      of my property!
  - type: 1
    number: 7
    date: 123355345999650
    content: Exploring the nothingness is easy. Once you see the first few kilometers
      you've seen them all. The only hard part is pushing aside any ideas of something
      hiding in the dark. Trust me, I'm the only thing here and I'm not hiding.
  - type: 1
    number: 8
    date: 123355345999650
    content: With time I've become really good at thinking. It only makes sense,
      it's almost exclusively the only thing I do. I've won and lost countless arguments
      and reformulated thousands of axioms. I should have written some of them down.
  - type: 1
    number: 9
    date: 123355345999650
    content: I wonder what people are doing back home. Are they still fighting? Or
      were they sufficently amazed by my prowess that peace now reigns? Have they
      given up borders? Have they made me a statue?
  - type: 1
    number: 10
    date: 123355345999650
    content: I've been thinking a lot about the statue of me back home. It defintly
      is very big. Afterall the bigger the acomplishment the bigger the statue. I
      hope it includes my ship. I also hope is made in a way that children can play
      in it. And that also serves as housing for the homeless. Also food. And made
      out of gold.
  - type: 1
    number: 11
    date: 123355345999650
    content: There is void, empty void, void with space dust, black void, sligtly
      grey void, static void, swirling void, void with something that turns out to
      be a smudge in the lens, void of despair, void of resignation, and, sometimes,
      very rarely, happy void (still undiscovered)
  - type: 1
    number: 12
    date: 123355345999650
    content: I have realized that my energy supply, and therefore, my food supply
      will last for another thousand years. I fucking hate engineers, they couldn't
      even give me the option to starve to death. If only I was a coward, I could
      take the easy way out.
  - type: 1
    number: 13
    date: 123355345999650
    content: I heard the gods talking the other day. They were discussing my fate.
      A few wanted to smite me for my defiance, others wanted me to ascend because
      of my bravery, a few wanted to be with me because of my good looks. The debate
      was heated until the fridge stopped defrosting and I couldn't hear them anymore.

    content: I just want to come back, set my feet on solid ground once more. I want
      to be able to stretch my arms. I want to be free again.
  - type: 1
    number: 15
    date: 123355345999650
    content: Don't know waht happened to me on my previous log. I love being in my
      space can, surrounded by empty void. I'm the best explorer any civilization
      has ever seen, and there's nothing to explore back home.
  - type: 1
    number: 16
    date: 123355345999650
    content: Now that a few years have come by I can confidently say this place is
      empty, and, therefore, I'm the first to discover it. I will name it "Hanert's
      Hole", because is mine, is a hole, and I like illiteration.

    content: Chapter 1, the day I was born, nobody else was. I was the first Arloran
      to be born at 76:34 on a Verten. A true visionary, on that day I knew I was
      destined for great things.

    content: This place is nice, quiet, empty. Not too empty thought, every now and
      then I can see stuff. Stuff is nice. I usually just stare at it for a while,
      and then I move on.

    date: 74437
    content: There isn't much to do in this place. I like that. I hate having too
      many options. I appreciate that my activity choices are limited. Float, watch,
      rest, eat. Easy.

    date: 74452
    content: Today I ate someone, it was nice. A new thing to do, it was not a log
      activity thought. But it was new. The little dude screamed something as they
      plunged into my mouth. It was interesting. I hope they are well. I don't know
      how it looks inside me.

    date: 74601
    content: Sometimes my stubborn mind decides to think, why little brain? It only
      brings us pain. Why do we need to think that we are alone? We don't care for
      company, I thought we had agreed on that part
  - type: 3

    content: I'm alone, brain thinking again. I'm also hungry, stomach bothering
      again. This is all brain's fault, they shuold keep stomach in check, but they
      are too busy thinking about loneliness.

    content: Ate an island today, didn't taste like much, it was fun though. I didin't
      finish it, it was too much. Probably will come back later, don't want anyone
      to think I'm rude.

      Where am I? This place feels damp, squishy and weirdly hot. Is this fucking
      flesh!? What the fuck?!

    date: 74695
    content: Looks like someone appeared in my mouth again. It's sad that I can never
      talk to them. They always dissapear before I spit them out. They aways leave
      behind clouds.

    number: 13
    date: 74758
    content: Sometimes I wish I could be a flower pot, I don't know why. I think
      brain just gets so bored that it doesn't want to exist anymore. I still think
      a flower pot would be calm and probably less demanding.

    content: Should I leave someday? Or should I just float around until I die? Or
      whatever happens at the end. I like the floating, I thinkI'll stay. Yeah, fuck
      you brain.
