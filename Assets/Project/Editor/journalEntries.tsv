Explorer	1	123355345999453	I've done it, I made it to the black hole, in a few days I'll be the first Arloran to venture inside. I'll be a legend.
Explorer	2	123355345999478	Aproach is inminent, collision expected in 20 minutes. I can feel the pull in my body. I can see the event horizon. I can feel history being made.
Explorer	3	123355345999650	I'm inside, I'm in the complete black void. My instruments detect absolutetly nothing, my eyes see nothing. I can only assume there is nothing here.
Explorer	4	123355345999650	It's been a year since my last entry, nothing happened since. Just me, my ship, my mind and my void. Today I felt like I should write this down for some reason.
Explorer	5	123355345999650	My instruments have detected something, a blip in the computer, a sound I had forgotten. Finally I have something to explore.
Explorer	6	123355345999650	I hit it! I'm stuck. I lost. I fear this is my end. I realeased my logs to the void. To whoever finds them. What the fuck where you thinking? Get out of my property!
Explorer	7	123355345999650	Exploring the nothingness is easy. Once you see the first few kilometers you've seen them all. The only hard part is pushing aside any ideas of something hiding in the dark. Trust me, I'm the only thing here and I'm not hiding.
Explorer	8	123355345999650	With time I've become really good at thinking. It only makes sense, it's almost exclusively the only thing I do. I've won and lost countless arguments and reformulated thousands of axioms. I should have written some of them down.
Explorer	9	123355345999650	I wonder what people are doing back home. Are they still fighting? Or were they sufficently amazed by my prowess that peace now reigns? Have they given up borders? Have they made me a statue?
Explorer	10	123355345999650	I've been thinking a lot about the statue of me back home. It defintly is very big. Afterall the bigger the acomplishment the bigger the statue. I hope it includes my ship. I also hope is made in a way that children can play in it. And that also serves as housing for the homeless. Also food. And made out of gold.
Explorer	11	123355345999650	There is void, empty void, void with space dust, black void, sligtly grey void, static void, swirling void, void with something that turns out to be a smudge in the lens, void of despair, void of resignation, and, sometimes, very rarely, happy void (still undiscovered)
Explorer	12	123355345999650	I have realized that my energy supply, and therefore, my food supply will last for another thousand years. I fucking hate engineers, they couldn't even give me the option to starve to death. If only I was a coward, I could take the easy way out.
Explorer	13	123355345999650	I heard the gods talking the other day. They were discussing my fate. A few wanted to smite me for my defiance, others wanted me to ascend because of my bravery, a few wanted to be with me because of my good looks. The debate was heated until the fridge stopped defrosting and I couldn't hear them anymore.
Explorer	14	123355345999650	I just want to come back, set my feet on solid ground once more. I want to be able to stretch my arms. I want to be free again.
Explorer	15	123355345999650	Don't know waht happened to me on my previous log. I love being in my space can, surrounded by empty void. I'm the best explorer any civilization has ever seen, and there's nothing to explore back home.
Explorer	16	123355345999650	Now that a few years have come by I can confidently say this place is empty, and, therefore, I'm the first to discover it. I will name it "Hanert's Hole", because is mine, is a hole, and I like illiteration.
Explorer	17	123355345999650	Chapter 1, the day I was born, nobody else was. I was the first Arloran to be born at 76:34 on a Verten. A true visionary, on that day I knew I was destined for great things.
Poet	1	3562	When glancing to the harsh unyielding sky<br>My mind, perchance, begins to wander so <br>Into a time when time would pass me by <br>My head, in England, constantly held low
Poet	2	3562	From birth my life continues void of luck <br>Yet no encounter fills me with such ire <br>Like when I think upon that dreaded pluck <br>That ripped me from The Globe engulfed in fire
Poet	3	3562	Surrounded by the licks of deadly flames <br>The brevity of life flashed fore mine eyes <br>If ere another human reads my claims <br>I know, with certainty theyâ€™ll claim them lies
Poet	4	3562	Escaping through the only open door <br>I fell through time and washed upon this shore
Poet	5	3562	My friend I found thee on a lifeless beach <br>The world around me falls into the void <br>An endless sky of stars beyond my reach <br>Converging on the shore, all else destroyed
Poet	6	3562	I fear my life will soon come to an end <br>My legacy, alone will obfuscate <br>Historians who stumble on my pen <br>And read the epic tale of my cruel fate
Poet	7	3562	This morn I saw the lights begin to shift <br>It seems to me that this phenomenon <br>Have may yet struck on more than just my rift <br>What wonders lie in endlessness on and on
Poet	8	3562	With this comes visitors now, new and old <br>Who linger in stagnation to behold
Poet	9	3562	The mysteries within just never cease <br>Today, a gift of life I stumbled on <br>Among the chaos, I discovered peace <br>The island, void of life, held hope beyond
Poet	10	3562	One day when I was walking on the edge <br>A vision struck; a new anomaly <br>Some cosmic burst destroyed a yonder ledge <br>The sight alone did then cause me to flee
Poet	11	3562	I ran into the nearby waterfall <br>And yet I was bewildered and amazed <br>The echo of mine voice answered the call <br>As if, within the mountain I had phased
Poet	12	3562	The beauty of the land beneath the wave<br>Which opened to the mouth of a new cave
Poet	13	3562	I realize now the cruelty of this fate <br>In which, alone, no one will know my name<br>Or know this tale of life, I am too late<br>My stories, told to no one, hold no fame 
Poet	14	3562	I will not leave this island nor return<br>Unto the time in which my soul resides<br>The meaning of my life, I now do learn<br>Was just to fade away within this tide
Poet	15	3562	When glancing on the harsh unyielding sky<br>My mind, perchance, begins to wander so<br>The breath of life seems to escape mine eye<br>As hopelessness and fright begin to grow
Poet	16	3562	I feel myself into the darkness slip<br>My life, succumbing to this dreadful blip
Colossus	1	3562	I never thought I would witness the end. I don't care what some are saying, this is the end. Our god fell, we are doomed.
Colossus	2	3562	What to do when god dies? Should we re-evaluate our beliefs? Maybe it was never a god, gods can't die. The Giver must have been something else, maybe an avatar for our true god?
Colossus	3	3562	Who will give us a food now? We are powerless without the Giver! How are we to obtain the energy to keep living?
Colossus	4	3562	This is the fault of the non believers. If it wasn't for their heresy the Giver would have had the strength to combat the black sun. We should punish them!
Colossus	5	3562	I think we should worship the black sun, it clearly is the stronger entity in all the land. If we pray to it, we will get the food we need.
Colossus	6	3562	They are gone, the body fell, crushed thousands in the process. Funny to think those were the lucky ones. Now we are fighting for the last scraps of energy.
Colossus	7	3562	I would have liked for our god to had died a different day, maybe a week later. At least I would have had my date by then, now it is just chaos. And nobody wants to date in the middle of chaos. 
Colossus	8	3562	The black sun cult has gained a lot of followers lately. And it seems to be working, the ground has started to shake. I hope we get food next.
Colossus	9	3562	I'm gone into hiding for my last days. The crazy cultists have decided to start sacrificing the ones that don't belive in the black sun. I would like to at least have the decency to die fro starvation.
Colossus	10	3562	I'm sure that at some point we crossed a line we shouldn't have. Somewhere between exiling non believers and sacrificing them to the black sun. I also don't think any of this is working, no food has rained since the Giver died.
Colossus	11	3562	It will never not be funny when I scrap some of the metal and the little crystal things go crazy. They look pretty dumb when they eat, I don't know why someone would want to research them. Nobody is here aside from me so I won't do it.
Colossus	12	3562	Fuck, the sun collapsed into a black hole. I'm sooo fucked. Welp, I had a good run.
Colossus	13	3562	Based on my power consumption I will probably be dead in a few days. I don't really have any regrets. Had a nice life in this planet. Though I never really did any of the research I should have.
Colossus	14	3562	This is my last recording. One minute until shutdown. Designation: TX345. Mission: Crystal based life identification. Progress: None, I didn't really like them so I just walked around for a few years. 
Whale	1	74434	This place is nice, quiet, empty. Not too empty thought, every now and then I can see stuff. Stuff is nice. I usually just stare at it for a while, and then I move on.
Whale	2	74437	There isn't much to do in this place. I like that. I hate having too many options. I appreciate that my activity choices are limited. Float, watch, rest, eat. Easy.
Whale	3	74452	Today I ate someone, it was nice. A new thing to do, it was not a log activity thought. But it was new. The little dude screamed something as they plunged into my mouth. It was interesting. I hope they are well. I don't know how it looks inside me.
Whale	4	74480	I found a cloud today. It was pretty and made out of static. I think it could talk. It was nice.
Whale	5	74532	I saw a cat the other day. At least that's what it said it was called. First time meeting one. It seemed nice. I wanted to pet it but it went away.
Whale	6	74589	Floating, vibing, floating, watching, sleeping, floating, waiting. What a life.
Whale	7	74601	Sometimes my stubborn mind decides to think, why little brain? It only brings us pain. Why do we need to think that we are alone? We don't care for company, I thought we had agreed on that part
Whale	8	74603	I'm alone, brain thinking again. I'm also hungry, stomach bothering again. This is all brain's fault, they shuold keep stomach in check, but they are too busy thinking about loneliness.
Whale	9	74650	Ate an island today, didn't taste like much, it was fun though. I didin't finish it, it was too much. Probably will come back later, don't want anyone to think I'm rude.
Whale	10	74678	Floating, not thinking, relazing, not hungry, sleeping, not alone, floating again, still not thinking, waiting, not thirsty
Whale	11	652	How the fuck? What is this? Why are my thoughts appearing in the air? Where am I? This place feels damp, squishy and weirdly hot. Is this fucking flesh!? What the fuck?!
Whale	12	74695	Looks like someone appeared in my mouth again. It's sad that I can never talk to them. They always dissapear before I spit them out. They aways leave behind clouds.
Whale	13	74758	Sometimes I wish I could be a flower pot, I don't know why. I think brain just gets so bored that it doesn't want to exist anymore. I still think a flower pot would be calm and probably less demanding.
Whale	14	75000	Should I leave someday? Or should I just float around until I die? Or whatever happens at the end. I like the floating, I thinkI'll stay. Yeah, fuck you brain.
